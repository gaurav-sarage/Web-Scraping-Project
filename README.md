# Web-Scraping-Project
Web scraping using libraries like pandas, requests and BeautifulSoup.
Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
The requests library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.
